## Learning Outcomes
During the course of this internship, I enhanced my skills in Python, data preprocessing, data visualization using Plotly, and integration of real-time conditional logic. Additionally, I gained experience in multilingual data presentation and GitHub version control for project submissions.

## Conclusion
The internship was highly beneficial in applying theoretical knowledge to a real-world project. I successfully completed all 5 tasks within the first month of my 6-month internship and am eager to take on new challenges to continue learning and contributing.
